# Advent Of Code 2022

My solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Language: [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)

### Project Structure
* one package for each day under [src/main/groovy](src/main/groovy) that contains:
  * 2 runnable classes for the 2 puzzles of that day, called **Day*N*.groovy** and **Day*N*_2.groovy**
  * additional models, if needed
* one resource folder for each day under [src/main/resources](src/main/resources) that contains:
  * **example.txt**: example input file provided
  * **real.txt**: real input file provided
  * additional files, when more examples are provided and/or input is different for part 1 and 2

> ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️<br>
> The goal is to solve puzzles as quick as possible, therefore the code is far from being elegant/optimized 😉
